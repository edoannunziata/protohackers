# protohackers

This repository contains:

* My own solutions to the [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) challenges.

* _popularity-contest_, a script that queries the Github, Gitlab and Protohackers APIs and makes
a chart of how many users used each programming language. The chart is automatically updated
and is available [here](https://edoannunziata.github.io/protohackers/pie.png). Shout-out to 
[jackharrhy](https://github.com/jackharrhy) for helping with the Github Workflow automation.
